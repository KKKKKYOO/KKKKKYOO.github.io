```bash
diff password.old password.new
```

**Pseudo Terminal (PTY)**
- We need a shell other than `bash` to access the system
- The details of all the shells that are available on a system is stored under `/etc/shells`

```terminal
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat /etc/shells
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/tmux
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/pwsh
/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh
/usr/bin/screen
```



- A software emulation of a physical terminal.

```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "/bin/sh"
```
- forces PTY allocation, even if SSH has no local tty. 


#### Shell and Shell Initialization

**SSH and Shell Types**
- When you connect to a remote system using SSH, the server starts the shell.
- The type of shell (login shell or non-login shell) determine which initialization scripts are run

**Login vs. Non-Login Shells**
Login Shell
- reads and executes commands from the list of `~.,bash_profile`,  `~/.bash_login`, `~/.profile` that exists and is readable.

Non-Login Shells
- You're running a command on a remote system without starting a new session.
- reads and executes commands from `~/.bashrc`

`ssh -t user@host`
- forces pseudo-terminal allocation. 
- This might affect whether `.bashrc` is executed or not by changing the type of shell that is started.
