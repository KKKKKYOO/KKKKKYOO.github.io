#### Side Note
##### Git Branches
In the realm of Git, branches are a fundamental concept, allowing for the development of multiple lines of work within the same repository.

**Managing Branches**
- A single Git repository can maintain multiple branches of development. 

```bash
git branch "test"
```
- Create a new branch named `test`


```bash
git branch
```
- Lists all existing branches

```bash
test
* master
```

```bash
git switch test
```
- Switch to the `test` branch. 
- We can edit a file, commit the change, and switch back to the `master` branch

```bash
git commit -a
git switch master
```
- `master` branch is unaffected by the changes made in `test` branch.

```bash
git merge test
```
-  We can merge the changes made in `test` to `master`

```bash
git branch -d test
```
- Delete the `test` branch

##### Production Environment
- This is where the software is available to end users or clients in its final form. It's the live environment where the application runs after it is deployed.
##### Development Environment
- This is where software is developed and initially tested. It's the playground for developers to write, debug, and enhance the code.

---

```bash
git branch -a
```
- Let's check the existing branches

```bash
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev
```
- Since current branch implies that it is the production environment, we can deduce `/dev` is the development environment.

```bash
git checkout remote/origin/dev
```

```bash
Note: switching to 'remotes/origin/dev'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 1d160de add data needed for development
```

```bash
cat README.md
```
- Full credential is included in branch `/dev`
