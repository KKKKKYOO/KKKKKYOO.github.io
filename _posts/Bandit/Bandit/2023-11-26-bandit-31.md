#### Clone Repo

```bash
mkdir /tmp/bacon31
cd /tmp/bacon31
git clone <ssh link>
```

#### Examine Repo
```bash
cd repo
cat README.md
```

```bash
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
```
- Pretty straightforward. It wants me to create a text file that has a string `"May I come in?"` and push the repo back to the branch.

#### Push Repo

```bash
touch key.txt
```

```bash
May I come in
```

```bash
git add key.txt
```

```bash
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
key.txt

hint: Use -f if you really want to add them
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"
```

#### Side Note

##### Git Ignore
`.gitignore` file in Git plays a crucial role in managing what gets tracked in a Git repository and what doesn't. Its a file where you specify rules to tell Git to intentionally ignore certain files and directories in your project. 

**Selective Tracking**
- Not all files in a project directory should be tracked by Git

**Cleaner Commits**
- It helps keep the commit history clean by excluding unnecessary or irrelevant files

**Avoiding Conflicts**
- Helps avoid conflicts with system-specific files and reduces noise in your repository

#### Examine `.gitignore`
```bash
ls -la
```

```bash
cat .gitignore
```

```bash
*.txt
```
- `.gitignore` implies that it will ignore any files with `.txt` extension


```bash
mv key.txt key
```

```bash
git reset
```
- Reset the index

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "May I come in"
```

```bash
git push
```

```bash
