**Reverse hexdump `data.txt` to create a binary file**
```bash
xxd -r data.txt foobar.bin
```

**Determine the type of the file using `file`**
```bash
file foobar.bin
```

```bash
zcat foobar.bin | bzcat | file -
```
- `file -`: determine the type of the file passed through `stdin`

**Chain appropriate commands to view the contents of the compressed file**
```bash
zcat foobar.bin | bzcat | zcat | tar xO | tar xO | bzcat | tar xO | zcat | cat 
```


`zcat`:  used for reading contents of files compressed with `gzip` compression. 
`bzcat`:  used for reading the contents of files compressed with `bzip2` compression.
`tar` : versatile tool used for archiving files
`tar xO`: extract files in archive to `stdout` rather than to the file system.
