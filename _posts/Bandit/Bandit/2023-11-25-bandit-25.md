```bash
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost -p 2220
```
- If we use the private key to login as `bandit26`, we are immediately logged out.

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```


```bash
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```

```bash
cat /usr/bin/showtext
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh
export TERM=linux
more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```
- Before exiting, `more ~/text.txt` is executed
- `more`: a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time. 

```bash
:set shell: <path to shell>
```
- In Vim, the `:set shell` command is used to specify or change the shell that Vim uses for executing shell commands.
- This is particularly useful if you want Vim to use a different shell than the system's default. 
- Resize the terminal windows to trigger `more` to go into its command view so that the program doesn't just exit. 

```bash
:set shell=/bin/bash
```

```
:shell
```

```
cat /bandit_pass/bandit26
```
