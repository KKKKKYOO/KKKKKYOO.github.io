`telnet`
- network protocol used for interacting with remote computers or servers.
- unlike `ssh`, `telnet` does not encrypt the connection, making it insecure for transmitting sensitive data. 

`nc`
- `netcat` is versatile networking tool (hackers swiss army knife)
- It can create almost any kind of connection and is commonly used for port scanning, transferring files, and creating server/client programs
- can either operate in `TCP`/ `UDP` mode and is useful for debugging and investigating network services

**Using `Telnet`**
```bash
telnet localhost port 30000
```

**Using `netcat`**

```bash
nc localhost 30000
```
