```bash
-rwsr-x---  1 bandit20 bandit19 7296 May  7  2020 bandit20-do
```

- because the binary `bandit20-do` has a `suid` enabled, I, as a `bandit19`, can execute the binary even though the owner of the file is `bandit20`

```bash
./bandit20-do
```

```bash
Run a command as another user.
	Example: ./bandit20-do id
```


```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```
